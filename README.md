# meowseeper

A browser game made as a birthday present. Click to open a square, right
click to mark a kitty. If you open a square with a kitty, it will cuddle
you to death and the game is lost. If all squares are either marked
correctly or open, the game is won.

**[Play here](https://tambeta.github.io/meowsweeper/)**.

Known bug: The settings system is a complex mess and should be
rewritten.

This is a legacy project not under active development. Feel free to fork
and improve.
